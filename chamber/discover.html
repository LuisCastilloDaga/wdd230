                    <p>Chancay Castle is a medieval-themed park located in the north of Lima (in the city of Chancay). It was built in the 1920s under the initiative of Consuelo Amat y León, great-granddaughter of Viceroy Manuel de Amat y Juniet who was also the wife of the mayor of Chancay Rómulo Boggio Klauer. The work stands out for its three levels, ten thematic rooms with museums and a replica of a ship located on a cliff facing the sea.
